        We’ve been speaking to people with disabilities about this and have heard that despite it being expensive to use other transport options like cars and taxis, and despite the fact that in some instances it leads to social isolation - it can be really difficult, uncomfortable and stressful for people with disabilities to navigate our public transport network.
